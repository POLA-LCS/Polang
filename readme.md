# Polang Interpreter

## Overview

Polang is a work-in-process interpreted language programmed in Python (so it's slow af).
It's a simple language with a focus on ease of use and a small set of features.
Polang is not intended to be a production-ready language, but rather a learning tool for me.
The syntax is designed to be similar to Assembly, with instructions and values.
It allows variable manipulation, conditional execution, integrated loops, and simple input/output operations.

### File Extension

Polang files should have the `.po` extension, unless it will not be interpreted (sorry :/)

### Types
- `string` : A python-like string.
- `number` : Numeric values such as 1, 2, 3.14, etc.
- `list`   : A collection of any kind of value.

### Constants
- `true`  : 1
- `false` : 0
